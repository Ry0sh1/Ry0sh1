Hello im Ryoshi
My real Life name is Dominik Fischer im Living in the north of Germany

I started Programming with Java in School 4 Years Ago but I was never motivated enough to keep doing this.
I am 19 Years old now (2023) and I just started programming seriously again because I want to become a great Full stack
developer.

I study computer science in an University in Oldenburg.

I will mainly use my Public GitHub like a diary to see my Progress and to improve properly.
